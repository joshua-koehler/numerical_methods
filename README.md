# Numerical Methods - TI BASIC Library for Students
TI BASIC library covering all standard numerical methods for root-finding, curve-fitting, interpolation, integration, differentiation, and 1st and 2nd Order ODEs.  Many of these programs contain multiple variations/methods inside of their menu options.  This library is written with the student in mind, and shows the steps that were used to arrive at the solution.  This is invaluable when checking work on numerical methods exams.  NUMER.8xg is a zip file of all the programs.  Simply download this file, and extract, to view the individual programs.\  

If you are new to TI BASIC, and want to edit/get a look at the programs with your computer, I highly recommend https://www.cemetech.net/sc/.  It is a free IDE for TI BASIC.  Simply load a program from this repository into the IDE, and it will display a nicely formatted version of the code that you can read, edit, and even emulate.

Please feel free to contact me on my linkedin @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-koehler-b37841175/ with any questions or suggestions.
I am open expanding the scope and usability of these programs if there is sufficient interest.
