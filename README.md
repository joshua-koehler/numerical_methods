# numerical_methods
TI BASIC library covering all standard numerical methods for root-finding, curve-fitting, interpolation, integration, differentiation, and 1st and 2nd Order ODEs.  Many of these programs contain multiple variations/methods inside of their menu options.  This library is written with the student in mind, and shows the steps that were used to arrive at the solution.  This is invaluable when checking work on numerical methods exams.

# Programs:

BISEC - Bisection Method - Root finding
\CRAMER - Cramer's Method - Solves system of equations
\DIFFBQ - Newer version of differential equation solver, with menu options for 1st or 2nd Order ODE, and Eulers, Heun, Ralston, Midpoint,            Runge Kutta 4th, and Kutta 4th for both
\DIRECT - Direct Method for nth order polynomial fit
\ERROR - Calculates Relative Approximate Error, Relative True Error, Absolute True Error, or Absolute Approximate Error (menu options)
\FINDDIF - Finite Difference Method - Differentiates 1st and 2nd derivatives from functions or lists with forward, backward, and central             methods, with higher order of accuracy options for the first derivatives
\GSQUAD - Gauss-Quadrature Integration - 1st and 2nd Order
